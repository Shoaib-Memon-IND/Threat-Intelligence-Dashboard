# Web-based Malware Detection System
In this project, we propose a web-based malware detection system, where a deep learning approach is developed to classify malware in an executable file. In contrast to the traditional malware detection systems based on the signature, our method is based on static detection to reveal malicious and benign files. We present an effective deep learning method to classify malicious software. The proposed method makes use of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network 1D-CNN due to the nature of the portable executable file.
